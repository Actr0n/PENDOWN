<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>While Markdown's redactional simplicity could be at the root of its success, unfortunately it also brings several 
quirks and limitations which may somewhat impede its usability in some cases.</p>

<p>This is probably why it has so many "flavors" trying to amend it in different ways.</p>

<p>While remaining in the same vein as its spiritual ancesort, <a href="https://github.com/senselogic/PENDOWN">Pendown</a> is 
actually quite different in its purpose.</p>

<p>Like Markdown, it's a lightweight markup language, but its syntax was also designed with presentational features
in mind, like text colors, font sizes, etc.</p>

<p>This means that generally it's absolutely not needed to use standard HTML tags along with these short tags, as all 
these features were already integrated in the language.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Although Pendown was initially inspired from Markdown, most of its tags are actually quite different, as they were chosen
according to different goals.</p>

<p>Here are a few sample tags :</p> 

<pre>
! Heading 1
!! Heading 2
!!! Heading 3
!!!! Heading 4
!!!!! Heading 5
!!!!!! Heading 6

**bold**
%%italics%%
^^superscript^^
,,subscript,,
~~strikethrough~~
__underlined__
##highlighted##

{{ span }}
{{{ div }}}
### box ###
+++ frame +++

:::^cpp\
// Colorized source code

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!";

    return 0;
}
:::

[[[
(( Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday ))
(( 1      | 2       | 3         ))
(( 1      | 2       | 3         ))
(( 1      | 2       | 3         ))
]]]

<h2>Styling</h2>

<p>The presentation of the document content (texts, images, etc) can easily be tweaked by using any available CSS class, 
including those predefined in <code>pendown.css</code>.</p>

<p>This can be done by adding custom lists of classes (or properties) right after the Pendown tags :</p>

<pre>
{{^big,red,yellow_background\ a big red text with a yellow background }}

{{^@2.5,$00f,#eee,black_outline\ a big blue text with a light gray background and a black outline }}
</pre>

You can also give a name to those lists, if you want to reuse them further in the document :

<pre>
{{^blue,italic:gangnam\ a blue text in italics }}

!^gangnam\ This title also uses the gangnam style.
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Pendown tags can be converted to HTML directly by the web browser when the file is opened, which is especially
convenient during its writing.</p>

<p>Here is a example of a HTML file whose content will be written using Pendown tags :</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta charset="utf8"/&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="pendown.css"&gt;
&lt;xmp&gt;
! This is the title
    
Put your **Pendown** text here :)
&lt;/xmp&gt;
&lt;script src="pendown.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
  
<p>Pendown documents can also be converted offline, using a command line tool :</p>

<p>For instance, the following command will convert all the Pendown tags of <code>input.pd</code> into standard HTML tags 
inside <code>output.html</code>.

<pre>
pendown --process --style input.pd output.html
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although Pendown isn't really a Markdown variant, it is unarguably a powerful alternative, especially for those who 
want to also control the presentation of their documents as easily as they would do in a word processor.</p>
